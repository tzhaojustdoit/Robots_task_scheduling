# Robot task scheduling

A robot system that can efficiently schedule robot tasks according to environmental information, including room occupation. This project is part of my master thesis -- Simulation of robot task scheduling method

# Requirements
[Ubuntu 16.04](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop-1604#1-overview)

[ROS](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)

[ROS simulation packages](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/)

[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

[MySQL Connector/C++](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-cpp/8.0/)
# Installation

1. Log in to MySQL server 

```
mysql -r root -p
```

2. Use SQL schema to create tables

```
source /home/[user_name]/catkin_ws/src/robot_navigation/sql/run.sql
```

3. Download this project to home/catkin_ws
    
    
```
git clone https://github.com/xuanjiao/robots_task_scheduling.git
```

# Usages
1.  Start Gazebo simulator

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo multi_turtlebot3.launch
```

2.  Start navigation stack

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo multi.launch
```

3.  Start ROS nodes: robots, centralized pool, charging station, sensor simulator, etc.

```
roslaunch robot_navigation move_demo.launch
```

# Main features
-   The door sensors can measure and store door status in the local table.
-   The robot can request the sensor data (table) as long as it enters the sensor range.
-   The robot then sends the acquired room occupation table to the centralized server.
-   The centralized server makes decisions based on the information from the robot and the environment. The decisions include selecting a navigation task, asking the robot to gather information from a specific sensor, asking the robot to recharge at a charging station, etc.
